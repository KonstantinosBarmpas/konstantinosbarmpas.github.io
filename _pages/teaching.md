I have assisted in supervising multiple PhD and Master’s students.

Teaching has been a core part of my academic journey. As a Teaching Assistant during both my undergraduate studies and PhD, I had the opportunity to collaborate with outstanding academics, gain substantial teaching experience, and develop my own teaching style. Some of the courses I supported are mentioned below. 

In recognition of my teaching contributions, I have been awarded Fellowship of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA).

Alongside my university teaching roles, I have also served as a mentor for Udacity students and for Greek high school students interested in pursuing STEM degrees in Greece or abroad.
