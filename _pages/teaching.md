Teaching is a core component of working in academia, so by working as a TA during my PhD as well as an undergraduate student, I had the chance to collaborate with brilliant academics, gain teaching experience and develop my own teaching style.â€¯Some of my TA roles are mentioned below. 

As a result of my teaching activities, I have been awarded the **Fellowship Advance Higher Education** (FHEA). 

In parallel to my university teaching roles, I have been a student mentor for Udacity students as well as for Greek high students who are interested in studying STEM courses in Greece or abroad.
