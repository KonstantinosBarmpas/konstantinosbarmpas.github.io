Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the [Department of Computing, Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing) developing Generative Foundation Models for Biosignals used in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). I have been awarded the Fellowship Advance Higher Education ([FHEA](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/fellowship)). I am a Member of European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems ([ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/members)).

PhD Graduate in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) from the [Department of Computing, Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing), where I conducted my research under the supervision of [Prof. Stefanos Zafeiriou](https://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/szafeiri/). My doctoral [thesis](https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/entities/publication/eb605ec6-4543-4a70-bf05-59cbb8481e2d), titled “Enhancing Motor-Imagery Brain-Computer Interfaces Through Deep Learning,” explored intersections between Deep Learning and Brain-Computer Interfaces, including Differentiable Signal Processing, Geometric Deep Learning and Causality. My work has been published in top-tier AI venues and has been featured at the [British Computing Society](https://digitalpioneers.bcs.org/series_partners/imperial-college-london/). I passed my PhD defence with **no corrections** and my thesis was awarded the 2nd Place in the G-Research’s Imperial College London PhD Prize 2024.

Since 2021, I have been working as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Cogitat](https://cogitat.io), where I develop innovative deep learning methods for EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). Our groundbreaking technology has been featured by outlets such as the [Sky News](https://news.sky.com/video/elon-musks-neuralink-company-implants-brain-chip-in-human-for-first-time-13060639), [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-64720533), [The Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/i-played-a-video-game-by-thinking-the-mind-reader-revolution-is-real-ml59c86mx), [Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/01/23/nhs-surgeon-challenging-musks-technology-connect-brain-internet/), [New Statesman](https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/big-tech/2024/01/mind-reading-elon-musk-neuralink), [Sifted](https://sifted.eu/articles/cogitat-grant-news/), and [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/these-are-13-wearable-technology-and-remote-monitoring-startups-2022-9). I have also participated in releasing interactive [demos](https://www.youtube.com/@cogitat1496) showcasing this technology.

In addition to my research, I have actively contributed to the academic community. During my postdoc, I served as the Postdoctoral Academic Representative and as a member of the Department of Computing’s Equity, Diversity, and Culture Committee ([EDCC])(https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/about/equality-and-diversity/edcc/)) at Imperial College London. During my PhD, I served as a PhD Student Academic Representative for the Department of Computing (Imperial College London), co-organized the London Geometry and Machine Learning ([LOGML](https://www.logml.ai/)) Summer School, led the Imperial Computing Conference ([ICC](http://icc.doc.ic.ac.uk/)) and participated in the Equity, Diversity, and Culture Committee ([EDCC](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/about/equality-and-diversity/edcc/)) at Imperial College London. I have also been involved as a [Lakera AI Student Momentum Ambassador](https://www.lakera.ai/momentum) and [Microsoft Student Ambassador](https://studentambassadors.microsoft.com/en-US/profile/106866). Furthermore, I have been a reviewer for many prestigious AI journals and conferences.

My past working experience includes in short: [Archimedes Research Unit](https://archimedesai.gr/en/) (Visiting AI Researcher), [Facesoft](https://www.linkedin.com/company/facesoftltd/about/) (Machine Leaarning / Software Engineering Intern), [Daedalean AI](https://daedalean.ai) (Machine Learning Thesis Project), [Smart Power Networks](https://smpnetworks.com) (Data Scientist) and [The Mouse Team](https://themouseteam.github.io) (Android Developer).

Prior to my PhD, I completed a Master of Engineering (MEng) at the [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/) and spent my final year at [ETH Zürich](https://www.ethz.ch/de.html), conducting my Master’s thesis at [Data Analytics Lab](http://www.da.inf.ethz.ch) under the supervision of [Prof. Thomas Hofmann](https://inf.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.hofmann.html). 

Before Imperial, during my gap year, I attended the bachelor's programme at the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/gr) and the Engineering Preparation programme at [Oxford Royale Academy](https://www.oxford-royale.com) (University of Oxford - St. Catherine's College). As a high school student, I was a national champion and a member of the Greek National Karate team.
